<h2>What is General Dentistry?</h2>
<p>General dentistry focuses on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of various dental conditions. General dentists are trained to provide a wide array of services, including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Preventive care: Routine check-ups, cleanings, and oral health education.</li>
<li>Restorative dentistry: Treatments for cavities, broken teeth, and other damage.</li>
<li>Surgical procedures: Extractions, including wisdom teeth removal.</li>
  </ol>
<p>By offering these services, general dentists play a vital role in helping patients maintain healthy teeth and gums throughout their lives.</p> 

 <h2> Teeth Cleaning: The Foundation of Oral Health</h2>
<p>Teeth cleaning is a fundamental aspect of preventive dentistry. Regular cleanings help remove plaque and tartar buildup, which can lead to cavities and gum disease.</p>

  <h3>Benefits of Teeth Cleaning</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prevents Tooth Decay: Professional cleanings eliminate plaque and tartar that brushing and flossing may miss, significantly reducing the risk of cavities.</li>
<li>Promotes Gum Health: Regular cleanings help prevent gum disease by removing harmful bacteria that can cause inflammation and infection.</li>
<li>Freshens Breath: A thorough cleaning removes food particles and bacteria, leading to fresher breath.</li>
<li>Enhances Aesthetics: Teeth cleaning can remove surface stains, resulting in a brighter smile.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Wisdom Tooth Extraction: A Common Surgical Procedure</h2>
<p>Wisdom tooth extraction is a common procedure performed to remove one or more of the third molars, which typically emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood. Many people require this procedure due to insufficient space in the mouth, leading to potential complications.</p>

  <h3>Reasons for Wisdom Tooth Extraction</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Impaction: Wisdom teeth can become impacted, meaning they do not fully emerge from the gums, leading to pain and infection.</li>
<li>Crowding: If there isn't enough space in the mouth, wisdom teeth can push against adjacent teeth, causing misalignment.</li>
<li>Cavities and Gum Disease: Wisdom teeth are located at the back of the mouth, making them difficult to clean. This can lead to cavities and gum disease.</li>
 </ol> 

<h2>  Conclusion</h2>
<p>General dentistry plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health through services such as teeth cleaning, dental filling, and wisdom tooth extraction. Regular visits to a general dentist can help prevent dental issues and ensure that any problems are addressed promptly. At Markham Gateway Dentistry, patients receive comprehensive care tailored to their individual needs, helping them achieve and maintain a healthy, beautiful smile.</p>
